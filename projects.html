									<h3 class="major">Chandler's side project philosophy.</h3>
									<p>Now that I'm officially a senior in college, what better time to state my opinion on the infamous side projects. Side projects are amazing in many aspects, they show passion, dedication, and relevant hands-on abilities that you don't get from your standard work experience. A lesser known aspect of side projects is that they also show that you don't go outside... Speaking from experience and the better days where I would participate in outdoor hobbies, side projects are too much to handle on top of the average full time CS major's workload.</br></br>Everywhere you look CS majors are encouraged to have an internship, certifications, side projects, work experience, hobbies, and good grades. While I for one have acquired these, it comes with the cost of social isolation. It is impossible to balance friends/partners/family/hobbies with everything that is requried by HR. On top of this, every second you spend away from computing will fill you with the anxiety that you're not doing enough. People wonder why most top performers in CS are socially inept, and I believe that it has to do with the crippling weight of failure CS majors feel. This mindset is even encouraged by industries all over preying on perfectionists.</br></br><strong>Moral of the story:</strong> Don't take side projects too seriously. Do what you enjoy and don't force yourself to create a format that will look good to HR. Enjoy the time you have off from school and work with a side-project that will actually spark interest. Most importantly, you're allowed to take breaks without feeling guilty!</p>
