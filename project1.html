                                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                                    <p>This project involved installing Arch Linux on my very first laptop, a Dell Vostro 1720. I first upgraded the HDD to a SSD and the 1gb of DDR2 RAM to 4gb. After installing Arch, I installed dwm from suckless.org as my window manager. I was going for a very minimalistic install due to the specs of the old laptop. Without futher ado, let's get started! </p>
                                    <!-- Preface -->
                                    <h3>Preface</h3>
                                    <p>This project started after a long battle on eBay. I wanted a Thinkpad x200 so that I could libreboot it and install Arch. This battle would prove to be unsuccessful after I was outbid... never to return to eBay again. Late into a Friday night I had an epiphany of all my old devices that I used to have. I immediately ran to my storage closet and there it sat: my very first laptop. Now the Dell Vostro Series must be embarrassingly average considering there's limited content online discussing it. Most searches pull up articles relating to the Inspiron series (which is a lot more widely known.)</br></br>Regardless, this laptop from 2009 holds a special place in my heart and reviving it with Linux would make little me proud.</p>
                                    <!-- Getting Started -->
                                    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                                    <p>First order of business is upgrading the horrendous specs that this laptop came with. Aside from building a PC when I was younger, I'm not too fluent in the hardware side of computing. I needed to research various ways to upgrade the laptop. Most articles recommended upgrading the HDD and RAM for up to a 70% performance boost. I liked those numbers, so I set out to purchase a 240gb SSD and two sticks of 2gb DDR2 RAM.</p>

                                    <div class="box alt">
                                        <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                                            <div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>I would've liked to have maxxed out the 8gb RAM capacity, but 4gb sticks of DDR2 are very pricey costing upwards of $100 for two. Once I got the 2gb sticks the installation was surprisingly simple and I could tell that a massive performance boost was gained. Now it's time to install Arch.</p>
                                    <!-- Installing Arch -->
                                    <h3>Installing Arch</h3>
                                    <div class="box alt">
                                        <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                                            <div class="col-10"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/arch logo.png" alt="" /></span></div>
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>For this install, I'm going to use the archinstall script which will automatically install a minimal version of Arch. I've installed Arch and Gentoo before manually, and would just prefer to have it done for me so I have more time for customization.</p>
