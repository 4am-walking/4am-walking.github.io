                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/about me pic.JPG" alt="" /></span>As mentioned before, my name is Chandler Matheny and I am a senior Cyber Security student at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. I was born in Kentucky and raised in Dyersburg, TN. I've always had a passion for "hacking" or whatever little me thought hacking was. From the moment I was introduced to Roblox on the family computer, I knew that this was going to be my future.</br><h3>How video games got me into Cyber Security</h3>Interestingly enough, my first cyber security debut came in the form of game hacking. Everyone wanted an advantage in Roblox games, so I downloaded Cheat Engine and learned how to find game values that correlated to memory addresses. For example, if I wanted infinite health in a game, I could single out the health value's memory address and overwrite it with something like 9999999. I would browse hacker forms quite often and loved to pretend like I was something big despite having zero understanding of any coding language. While I might seem like a script kiddie in this phase, the worst was yet to come.</br></br>Around age 11 or 12, I started downloading hack clients for Minecraft and my grandfather first introduced me to Linux: specifically Kali Linux on a USB. I remember being ecstatic the day I got Kali because I thought I was going to become a l33t h4x0r just by owning it. My first order of business, like any skid who has no idea what they're doing, was to hack the instagram pages of people who were mean to my friends. Unsurpisingly, this failed miserably although I did manage to get some type of brute force attack going which scared the victim. I remember my favorite thing to do in this phase was to open the dev tools on websites and change the html/js to impress my friends.</br></br>A few years passed, and after taking some coding camps in the summer and learning scratch/html I was finally taking computer science courses in high school. At this point I was fascinated with ethical hacking and penetration testing. I started learning about flashing and virtual machines so that I could run Kali on my PC. I also dual booted Ubuntu alongside Windows. It was also at this time that I decided on going to UTC because they were one of the very few in-state colleges offering a cyber security program. </p>
